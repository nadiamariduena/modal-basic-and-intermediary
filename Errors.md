### When the buttons dont work üëç

##### If you cannot click on the buttons when (sliding or closing the modal) for example:

<br>

- Hide all the styles related to it (to be sure, hide all the styles related to the project)

<br>

- Then proceed to check if the code on the buttons is alright

<br>

#### I had a similar issue after finishing the project and then returning to test it again the day after, strangely nothing worked like the previous day, it was strange for me "since everything was fine few hours earlier", so after removing all the unecessary components etc (As a last resort), I opted for hiding the styles, so to concentrate on the code only, and there was it, the code was working fine, so the problem was coming from the styles.
